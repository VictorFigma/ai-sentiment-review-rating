## 🧠 Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews 🌟

## 📸 Context
This project was created as part of a job application challenge to showcase my skills. It utilizes a dataset that cannot be shared due to (potential) confidentiality reasons, and no PRs are allowed.

## 📁 How to execute 

 1. Insert 2 valid .csv datasets in the test/train folders.

 2. Run: train, validate and predict.
    ```
    python model.py
    ```

## 🎯 Tasks

"Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to craft a classification model that can predict the "rating" of a review, relying solely on its textual content. The company has made some tweaks and omissions to safeguard user privacy. Thus, they'll supply you with just two features to work on: 'Summary' and 'Text'."
